Instructions:

1. Install [Melonloader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader.Installer/blob/master/README.md#how-to-install-re-install-or-update-melonloader) and start the game once
2. Find the latest [Release](https://github.com/ITR13/Demon-Bluff-Art-Swap-Mod/releases) of the mod
3. Close the game and place ArtSwap.dll into your "Mods" folder
4a. If you want to use a custom deck (for example the Inverted Cards that's released with the mod), place the ArtSwap folder into the Mods folder too
4b. If you want to make your own deck, start the game once and wait until the music starts playing (the game needs to be in focus). After that, close the game, and edit the images in the newly created ArtSwap folder.
5. If you want to remove any modifications, just delete the ArtSwap folder and it will regenerate with the default art next time you open the game.  

You can also press F7 to reload the images while you're still in game.
