### Instructions

1. Install [Melonloader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader.Installer/blob/master/README.md#how-to-install-re-install-or-update-melonloader) and start the game once.
2. Find the latest [Release](https://github.com/ITR13/Demon-Bluff-Art-Swap-Mod/releases) of the mod.
3. Close the game and place **ArtSwap.dll** into your **Mods** folder.
4. To use or create custom decks/skins:
   * **4a.** You can make additional skins by adding a new folder inside **Mods/Skins/**. Use the included **Inverse** folder as a reference.
   * **4b.** If you want to use a pre-made custom deck (for example, the Inverted Cards thatâ€™s released with the mod), place the provided **ArtSwap** folder into the **Mods** folder.
   * **4c.** If you want to make your own deck, first start the game once and wait until the music starts playing (make sure the game window is in focus). After that, close the game and edit the images inside the newly created **ArtSwap** folder.
5. If you want to remove any modifications, just delete the **ArtSwap** folder. It will regenerate with the default art the next time you open the game.

You can press **F7** in-game to reload the images without restarting the game.
